            <p class = "content__text">As a final project of the Computer Engineering degree, my friend Narcís Bustins Núñez and I made a 2.5D adventure/platform videogame in Unity. We worked for 6 months, spending all available hours on the project, and we are really proud and satisfied with the final result.</p>
            <p class = "content__text">The game is composed by two levels, one that acted as an introduction and as a tutorial, and a final one with a final boss to conclude the game.</p>
            <p class = "content__text">We modeled some of the objects we used, like the main player or the following buddy, but we mostly used assets from the Unity Store or other websites.</p>
            <p class = "content__text">We programmed all the behaviors and systems of this game, that include: </p>
            <ul class = "content__list">
                <li>Player</li>
                <p>This system allows the control of the player in a 2.5D Space, with a horizontal and vertical movement.</p>
                <p>This includes all the main mechanics of movement: move, jump, crouch and dash.</p>
                <li>Combat System</li>
                <p>A system that would allow different entitites (player and enemies) to make, recieve damage and die.</p>
                <p>This system includes features to make damage with melee weapons, or throw damaging projectiles.</p>
                <li>Enemies</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Melee enemy: a humanoid that would follow the player and attack when is close to it.</li>
                    <li>Ranged enemy: a humanoid that would follow the player and throw at it when in range of attack.</li>
                    <li>Slime enemy: the fastest enemy that would follow the player and throw himself at it when in range.</li>
                    <li>Final boss: a humanoid with different attacks and abilities. It has different phases based on how much health it has, making it harder on low hp.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Experience System</li>
                <p>A full system that allowed the player to earn experience points when killing enemies, and then a system that would allow the player to spend these points on unlockable abilities and upgrading player stats like max HP, armor, etc.</p>
                <li>Other</li>
                <p>And many others like <b>Animations</b>, <b>Traps</b>, <b>Consumables</b>, <b>Maskarea System</b> (the entity that follows the player), etc. Find more information in the documentation!</p>

            <p class = "content__text">As part of our Master's Degree program, we developed a small video game engine individually made from scratch in C++ and OpenGL. Mine was named <b>IsItRealEngine</b> and it could render 2D images and 3D models, as well as importing new models, allowed camera movement and management, configuration and monitoring panels.</p>

            <p class = "content__text">Once we developed our own video game engines, we grouped in pairs and created a more advanced engine.

            <p class = "content__text">In the Master's degree, after the release of RealDisunity, we had to create a video game engine in collaboration with all the students of the masters, and we ended up creating an advanced engine called <b>Tesseract Engine.</b></p>

            <p class = "content__text">These are the features I worked on:</p>
            <ul class = "content__list">
                <li>2D Components</li>
                <ul>

                    <p>Allowing a 2D GameObject to be rotated and placed at any position of the screen.</p>
                    <li>Component Image</li>
                    <p>Which allowed the visual representation of a 2D image or a color.</p>
                    <li>Component Text</li>
                    <p>A colorized multiline 2D text. Could be centered horizontally in 3 different positions: left, center or right.</p>
                </ul>

                <li>Graphics</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>MSAA</li>
                    <p>Allowing a 2D GameObject to be rotated and placed at any position of the screen.</p>
                    <li>Unlit Shader</li>
                    <p>Which allowed the visual representation of a 2D image or a color.</p>

                </ul>

                <li>Navigation Module</li>
                <p>I created the Navigation Module, integrating <b>Recast & Detour libraries</b> to generate a Navigable Mesh from the Engine, and that would also allow a Navigation Agent to roam around the NavMesh, or Navigation Obstacles that would limit the NavMesh movement.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Component NavAgent</li>
                    <p>Allows a GameObject to roam a NavMesh. It had a maximum speed and acceleration, and an "Avoid obstacles" option could be set. This was used in the player controller and the enemies controller.</p>
                    <li>Component Obstacle</li>
                    <p>Allows a GameObject to modify the NavMesh in order to limit the movement through the NavMesh. The Obstacle can have different sizes and shapes: cylinder or a box shape.</p>
